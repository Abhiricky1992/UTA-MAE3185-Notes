# Preliminaries
Now that you have brushed up on the basics of C/C++ programming, let's discuss some basics necessary for this course. This chapter introduces some small discrete concepts that will facilitate the understanding of how computers work. Although these concepts are not discussed in too much detail, having a basic idea helps in learning other topics discussed later in this course.
