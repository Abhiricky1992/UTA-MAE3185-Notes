# Program Structure
Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.

## Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts,
- Preprocessor Commands
- Functions
- Variables
- Statements & Expressions
- Comments

Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World",
```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
   /* my first program in C */
   printf("Hello, World!\n");
   
   return 0;
}
```
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program,
- The first line of the program `#include <stdio.h>` is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
- The next line `int main()` is the main function where the program execution begins.
- The next line `/*...*/` will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
- The next line `printf(...)` is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
- The next line `return 0;` terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
