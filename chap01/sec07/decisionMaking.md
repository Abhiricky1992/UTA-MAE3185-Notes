# Decision Making
Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be `true`, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be `false`. Any non-zero and non-null values are assumed as `true`, and zero or `null` values are assumed as `false` values.
C programming language provides the following tow main types of decision making statements.
- `if`-`else` statement
- `switch` statement

## `if`-`else` statement
The `if`-`else` statement allows the code inside `if` block to be executed if the given condition is `true`, otherwise the code inside `else` block is executed.

Following is the syntax of an `if`-`else` statement,
```c++
if(condition)
{
    // execute statement of if block when
    // condition is true
}
else
{
    // execute statement of else block when
    // condition is false
}
```

Following is an example that uses `if`-`else` statement to decide if a variable holds value smaller than 20 or not.
```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    if (a < 20)
    {
        printf("Given value is less than 20.\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Given value is greater than 20.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## The `?` `:` operators
Operators `?` and `:` are known as conditional operators which can be used to replace `if`-`else` statements. It has the following general form
```c++
Exp1 ? Exp2 : Exp3;
```
Where `Exp1`, `Exp2`, and `Exp3` are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon. The result of line above is computed by evaluating `Exp1`. If it is `true`, then `Exp2` is evaluated and its value becomes the result. However, if `Exp1` is `false`, then `Exp3` is evaluated and its value becomes the result.

Following is an example that uses `?` `:` operators to decide if a variable holds value smaller than 20 or not.
```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    printf("Given value is %s than 20.\n", a < 20 ? "less" : "greater");
    return 0;
}
```

## `switch` statement
A `switch` statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a `case`, and the variable being switched on is checked for each switch case. Following is the syntax for a `switch` statement,
```c++
switch(variable or expression) {
   case value1 :
      statement(s);
      break; /* optional */
   case value2 :
      statement(s);
      break; /* optional */
   /* you can have any number of case statements */
   default : /* Optional */
   statement(s);
}
```
`break` in the syntax above is a keyword that is used to stop the execution inside a switch block. It helps to terminate the switch block and break out of it. And, the `default` keyword is used to specify the set of statements to execute if there is no case match. Following code shows the usage of `switch` statement.
```c++
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   char grade = 'B';
   switch(grade) {
        case 'A' :
            printf("Excellent!\n" );
            break;
        case 'B' :
            printf("Well done!\n" );
            break;
        case 'C' :
            printf("Good!\n" );
            break;
        case 'D' :
            printf("You passed!\n" );
            break;
        case 'F' :
            printf("Better try again!\n" );
            break;
        default :
            printf("Invalid grade.\n" );
   }
   printf("Your grade is  %c\n", grade );
 
   return 0;
}
```
